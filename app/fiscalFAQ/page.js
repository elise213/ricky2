      <p className="question">What does Fiscal Sponsorship mean?</p>
      <p className="answer">
        Fiscal Sponsorship is when a film, related project, or event aims to
        secure funding from sources like individuals, foundations, government or
        corporate bodies that exclusively donate to nonprofit entities with IRS
        tax-exempt status. To qualify as an exempt, an organization needs to
        possess a valid 501(c)(3) certificate issued by the IRS.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        Does acquiring a fiscal sponsor confer a nonprofit status on me/my
        project?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        No, having a fiscal sponsor affiliated with a nonprofit does not grant
        an individual or project a nonprofit or tax-exempt status. Only the IRS
        is authorized to issue a tax-exempt designation.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        What advantages does my project gain from securing Fiscal Sponsorship
        from CCEA?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        Securing Fiscal Sponsorship from CCEA opens up avenues to receive
        donations from individual benefactors, foundations, and other financial
        backers who only contribute to recognized 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit
        entities. Individual donors may also be encouraged by the prospect of
        supporting your film through tax-deductible contributions.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        Does my project maintain its independent legal identity under fiscal
        sponsorship?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        Absolutely. Your project maintains its distinct legal entity. It
        continues to be under your creative control and ownership, and you
        remain responsible for tax reporting and liability. CCEA does not claim
        any rights in the project.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        Is it possible to seek Fiscal Sponsorship for multiple projects?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        Yes, however, each project will require a separate application
        submission.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        When is the opportune time to seek Fiscal Sponsorship?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        Applications for fiscal sponsorship are entertained continuously,
        welcoming projects at any phase, be it development, production, or
        post-production. Please account for a review time of around 1- 4 weeks
        when planning your submission.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        What type of projects does CCEA consider for Fiscal Sponsorship?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        CCEA embraces independent projects encompassing narrative and
        documentary styles of any duration and genre. Furthermore, CCEA supports
        various other projects and entities aligned with its mission, and/or in
        the pursuit of attaining their 501(c)(3) status, including interactive
        media, podcasts, film festivals, and more.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        Is there a requisite project stage to apply for Fiscal Sponsorship?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        Fiscal Sponsorship applications are open at any stage of production,
        right from early development to post-production phases. Applications are
        also entertained with the objective of funding film festival
        participations and/or distribution expenses.
      </p>

      <p className="question">Can non-U.S. citizens apply for sponsorship?</p>
      <p className="answer">
        Absolutely, we are open to applications from individuals outside the
        U.S. However, be aware that certain tax limitations might be applicable.

      <p className="question">
        What are the financial obligations associated with the Fiscal
        Sponsorship program?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        Projects accepted into the program will be levied a 4% administrative
        fee on contributions directed towards projects.
      </p>
      <p className="question">
        Could you explain the distinction between a donor and an investor?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        The terms "donor" and "investor" bear distinct meanings. A donor
        financially supports your project and receives a tax receipt, without
        any entitlement to project profits. Conversely, an investor backs your
        project financially, anticipating a return on the investment, inclusive
        of the principal amount, but cannot avail of tax receipts for the
        invested capital.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        Can my project secure funding from both donors and investors?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        Yes, you can indeed. However, CCEA can only accept funds from donors,
        and only these contributors are eligible for tax deductions on their
        donations.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        What is the procedure to request fund disbursement?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        You are free to request a fund disbursement at any juncture. There is no
        fixed limit on the amount that can be requested, as long as sufficient
        funds are present in your account. However, we advise against
        withdrawing more than what is anticipated to be utilized in a fiscal
        quarter. Weekly disbursements are processed through ACH, reflecting in
        your account on Fridays. Requests need to be submitted by 5:00 pm PT on
        Mondays to be included in that week's ACH run. Late submissions will be
        considered for the next week's ACH cycle. If Monday is a holiday, the
        deadline moves to the subsequent working day.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        Can my project obtain fiscal sponsorship from multiple organizations
        simultaneously?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        If you have initiated the fiscal sponsorship application process with
        another entity, kindly refrain from applying with CCEA until the outcome
        of your previous application is clear.
      </p>

      <p className="question">
        What reporting obligations are imposed on project representatives?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        Project representatives are mandated to furnish an annual report to
        CCEA. This report serves as a progress tracker for your project and an
        opportunity to update us on any developments or alterations witnessed
        during the past calendar year. This report should be accompanied by a
        cost report delineating the allocation of funds disbursed to you
        throughout the last calendar year. If your project has wrapped up, the
        annual report needs to be complemented by a final cost report.
      </p>
      <p className="question">When can I apply, and when will I hear back?</p>
      <p className="answer">
        The CCEA accepts applications throughout the year. All applications will
        be reviewed by the Fiscal Sponsorship Committee to determine if they fit
        CCEA's requirements. Applicants will be notified of the status of their
        application via email within 2-3 weeks of receipt.

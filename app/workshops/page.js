          We are dedicated to nurturing a deeper appreciation for 8mm and 16mm
          filmmaking. Our workshops offer hands-on experience shooting and
          editing analog film using our Bolex Reflex cameras and analog editing
          equipment. Our development sessions introduce participants to
          eco-friendly processing methods using household items to develop film
          in a manner that's environmentally conscious, non-toxic, and
          inexpensive. With the artist's permission, the films made in the
          workshops will be shown at one of CCEA's public screenings.
